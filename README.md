# Data Placement Algorithm for Balanced Recovery Load Distribution
This repo contains the `go` source code of the data placement algorithm, along with the microbenchmark.

To run the algorithm and get the results of microbenchmark, simply run `go run main.go`. 

The results of the micro benchmark for figures in the paper will be in `Figure 3(a).csv`,`Figure 3(b).csv`,`Figure 4(a).csv`,`Figure 4(b).csv` respectively.
